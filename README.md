What the heck is this?
---
This is a list of city labels used by many [Stamen](http://stamen.com)-designed basemaps, such as [Toner](http://maps.stamen.com/toner) and [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com)'s [Positron and Dark Matter](http://cartodb.com/basemaps) styles. This list was once used as the input to [Dymo](https://github.com/migurski/dymo), which is a placement script for map labeling, using simulated annealing.

Mostly the data appears to come from [Geonames](http://geonames.org), with a significant amount of modification and hand-curation by previous Stamen employees and collaborators. Much of its origins have now been lost to the mists of time.

What's up with the name?
---
We call it "magic" because we're not exactly sure how it was originally generated. We could probably find out, we just haven't tried to dig that deep.

We call it "aries" because a long time ago this dataset included a misspelling of Buenos Aires. Long-live the lost city of Buenos Aries!
